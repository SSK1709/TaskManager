## Description

A simple task manager that lets users add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete. Built for my IB Computer Science IA using object-oriented programming and persistent storage.

## Features

* Add new tasks
* Edit and delete tasks
* Mark tasks as completed
* Persistent local database
* Clean, intuitive interface

## Technologies Used

* Python
* SQLite (for task storage)

## Installation / How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project folder
3. Install required dependencies (if any)
4. Run the program:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Database

The `tasks.db` file is **not included** in the repository.
A new database will be automatically created on first run.

## Future Improvements

If you want, I can write a more formal IB-style “Design, Record of Tasks, and Development” summary or tailor this based on whether it’s GUI/CLI, what libraries you used, or what your class structure looks like.
